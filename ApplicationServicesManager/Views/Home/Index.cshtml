            A Client Application ID and a Client Secret will be automatically generated.
            During registration you can select the appropriate access roles. This information
            is used by your application to obtain the appropriate oAuth2 tokens
            (refresh and session) to access the specified WebAPI methods.

        <h2>Update and existing client application</h2>
        <p>
            Update an exiting application's description and add or remove access roles. You should
            only select roles that you application needs to perform its function. While you will see
            a complete list of registered client applications, you can only modify or remove client
            applications that you have registered.

        <h2>Manage Roles</h2>
        <p>
            Manage the roles that may be assigned to a client application. This is normally an
            administrative function.  While you may add new roles they will only be consumed if
            they are referenced in a WebAPI that utilzes the Application Services Manager.
